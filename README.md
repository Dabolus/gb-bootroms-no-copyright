# GB/GBC Bootstrap ROMs

In this repository, you can find bootstrap ROMs for GB/GBC.
These ROMs will reproduce the original animation you can find on real hardware,
but without including the Nintendo logo (copyright-protected) and its checksum
test with the logo in the cartridge header (patent-protected).

The reason why I implemented these ROMs is to be able to simulate the original
GB/GBC experience in emulators, but without the legal issues that come with
the original ROMs.
